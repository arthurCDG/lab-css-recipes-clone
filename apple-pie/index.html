          <p id="recipe-description">This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always
            be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your
            favorites as well!</p>

          <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li class="direction-li">Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.</li>
            <li class="direction-li">Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.</li>
            <li class="direction-li">Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</li>
